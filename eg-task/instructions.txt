Hello there,

Before we can consider your CV for a technical interview, weâ€™d like to ask you to perform a short tech task for us to evaluate your skills and coding approach. Please follow the instructions below to complete the task:
1. Create an empty public Github repository
2. Initialize a Cypress project there (use any version you like)
3. Create an npm script to run the task.html file on a localhost
4. Cover every element in the html with at least one meaningful test that can guarantee its proper work (you can add more tests if you wish). IMPORTANT: the content of the iframe is considered to be one element meaning there's no need to test all tabs and things there
5. Send a link to your Github repository to the recruiter

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Javascript or Typescript (TS is more preferable but JS is fine as well)
- Use Prettier to prettify your code, make sure to include the config in your project
- Read necessary data from the Cypress environment
- Mock any request using a fixture file
- Use the Page Object pattern
- If you use any 3-rd party libraries, make sure to leave a comment on why you use them
- Create npm scripts for running your tests both in UI (Cypress runner) and headless modes
- Read the alert-text.txt file and use its contents as the text to invoke the alert. The reading itself must be done by Node.js via cy.task

Wishing you good luck,
The Easygenerator Test Automation team
